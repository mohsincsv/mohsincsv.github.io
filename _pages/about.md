Hi, I am Mohsin Iqbal, a Pre-Doctoral Researcher at Fatima Research Fellowship, where I have the privilege of working with <a href="https://xiaoiker.github.io/">Dr. Wei Peng</a>, a Research Scientist at <a href="http://cnslab.stanford.edu/">CNSlab, Stanford University</a>. We are currently working on developing multi-modal model, building multi-agent LLM systems, and their biomedical applications. 

Recently, I completed my Bachelor's in Computer Science from the University of Central Punjab, Pakistan, where my senior year thesis <i>“GI Tract Image Segmentation Using Deep Learning”</i> was nominated for the <b>Thesis of the Year Award</b>.

I like to work on socially impactful applied research in computer science, data science and artificial intelligence that improves people's lives. Similarly, my <b>research interests</b> include machine learning, computer vision, and AI for healthcare. Through my work, I aim to advance knowledge and ultimately make meaningful contributions to society’s betterment.

In addition to research, I find teaching and mentoring students deeply fulfilling. I have served as a teaching assistant for three different classes and enjoy working closely with students to support their learning and growth. 

Moving forward, I aspire to a career that blends interdisciplinary research, collaboration, mentorship and teaching.

Please see my CV for more information about my background and experience.
