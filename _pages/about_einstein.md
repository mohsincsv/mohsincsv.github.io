Hi, I'm Mohsin Iqbal, a Pre-Doctoral Researcher at Fatima Research Fellowship, where I am lucky to work with Dr. Wei Peng, Research Scientist, at CNSlab, Stanford University, on development of foundation language models. I recently completed my Bachelor in Computer Science from University of Central Punjab, Pakistan.

I like to work on socially impactful applied research in computer science that help improve people's lives. My research includes artificial intelligence, computer vision, machine learning, AI for humans and its biomedical applications. I aim to contribute to the advancement of knowledge and ultimately make substantial contributions to the betterment of society.

In addition to research, I also love teaching and mentoring younger students and aspire to a career that combines teaching, collaboration, and mentorship with research. I have been a teaching assistant three times for three different classes and enjoy working with students.
